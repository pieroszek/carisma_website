# Carisma Charity Shop Website
Please note that i am missing up to date info to finish the website, so a big chunk of the project is subject to change (design wise). 

About This Project
This project showcases a static website developed from scratch for the Carisma charity shop chain based in Andorra. As part of my academic requirements, I engaged in volunteering and chose to extend my contribution by developing a practical tool. This website aims to support Carisma's mission by enhancing their online presence and accessibility, serving as a tangible asset to aid their charitable activities.

## Project Inspiration

The inception of this project stemmed from numerous discussions with the dedicated team at Carisma. Understanding their needs and the constraints they face, I designed the website to be user-friendly, ensuring it caters to a broad age group ranging from 18 to 65+ years, including those with minimal technical skills. The decision to avoid complex frameworks or dependencies was deliberate to simplify maintenance and ensure ease of use for Carismaâ€™s staff and volunteers.

## Running the Website

The website is designed as a static page using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which means it's incredibly straightforward to get up and running:

### Download and run locally
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in a web browser or through a development tool of your choice.

Example using Visual Studio Code (VSCode):

Open the project folder in VSCode.
Utilize the debugger or Live Server extension to serve the website locally on your device.
This simplicity ensures that anyone, regardless of technical expertise, can view and interact with the website with minimal setup.


### Through github pages
I have made a deployed version of the design testable using github pages letting anyone quickly seeing how the website feels

please note i havent put in logic to adapt to difrent screen sizes
